# nanobody-structure-prediction
Deep learning project for predicting protein structures
This project applies deep learning to predict nanobody 3D structures based on amino acid sequences.  
Using PDB files, one-hot encoding, and a ResNet-style neural network built with Keras, the model generates atom-level coordinates and compares results to AlphaFold benchmarks.

📁 Tools: Python, Keras, NumPy, sklearn, Google Colab (GPU)  
📊 Key Topics: Bioinformatics, Deep Learning, Protein Folding, Sequence Modeling  
📌 Grade: 100
